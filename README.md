# Jupyter Translate: a Python script for translating Jupyter notebook files

[version 2024]

This script was created as a general-purpose translator for Jupyter notebooks, translating from English to any other language. Hereâ€™s an example of how to use it:

```
python jupyter_translate.py index.ipynb --language 'pt'
```
A new file named `index_pt.ipynb` will be created (or the code of the language you decided to use). There is also a script for automatically translating all .ipynb files in a folder and its subfolders. Additionally, you can use a version of the script that converts Portuguese notebooks to English:
```
python jupyter_translate_pt2en.py index.ipynb
```
The program translates markdown content, comments in code cells, and messages formatted in  `print(f" ... ")`. 

OBS: jupyter-translate uses [googletrans](https://py-googletrans.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) on its backend. The --language option can be set to any of the following:

## Implementation notes
To set up a working Conda environment to use this tool, you must install `fire` from conda-forge and a newer version of `googletrans` via pip, as well as a few other libraries. You can do this with the included environment file. In your terminal, enter:
```
conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate jtranslate
```
**Note**: Copy and execute each line one by one -- not as a block.

If you have any question or suggestion, use the *pull request* or discussion option in github.
